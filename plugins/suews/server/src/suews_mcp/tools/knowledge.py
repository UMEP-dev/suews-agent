# Rename registry, loaded once (gh#1762).
#
# ``_legacy_names_in_text`` needs ``ALL_FIELD_RENAMES`` from supy's
# data-model layer. Importing it pulls in the whole data model and,
# with it, numpy - roughly 630 modules and several compiled
# extensions. That import used to happen lazily inside the function
# body, which this server's ``_async_offload`` wrapper runs on an
# anyio worker thread (gh#1439). On Windows the first such import
# never completed: the stack capture on gh#1762 shows the worker
# thread blocked inside ``create_module`` for numpy's
# ``_multiarray_umath`` (the ``LoadLibraryExW`` call, which holds the
# OS loader lock) with the main thread idle, so the tool call never
# returned and the MCP session stalled for good.
# The same import on the process's main thread completes in about a
# second on the same machine and interpreter.
#
# The registry is therefore loaded eagerly, on whichever thread calls
# :func:`preload_field_renames`; the server calls it at start-up,
# before FastMCP builds its event loop and worker-thread pool. The
# same call builds the detection index below, so the regex
# compilation is paid once, on the main thread, too. Tool bodies then
# only read the cached mapping and index. Callers that never preload
# (unit tests importing the tool functions directly, an older supy
# without the registry) still work: the first annotated match loads
# it in place, and a failed import degrades to no annotation rather
# than an error, exactly as before.

# deliberate (gh#1402: the detector must see names past the snippet
# prefix), so the order is not the defect; the per-name loop was. A

    knowledge-pack staleness window (gh#1407).

    Audience annotations (gh#1402)
    ------------------------------

    Each match carries an ``audience`` tag derived from its
    ``repo_path``:

    - ``user_yaml`` — Pydantic data-model code or generated schema
      artefacts; safe to quote as the YAML field shape.
    - ``internal_runtime`` — Fortran kernel, Rust bridge, or
      validation pipeline; field names here are NOT necessarily the
      ones the user writes in YAML.
    - ``developer_doc`` — everything else (release notes, design
      docs, tutorials).

    When a match's text contains one or more legacy field names
    (taken from ``ALL_FIELD_RENAMES``), an additional
    ``legacy_name_for`` list is attached — e.g.
    ``[{"legacy": "stebbsmethod", "current": "stebbs"}]``. Use the
    ``current`` form when generating user-facing YAML.

    Envelope size policy (gh#1403)
    ------------------------------

    A typical knowledge match is one source chunk (Fortran module,
    Pydantic class, docs page); chunks routinely exceed the agent's
    per-tool-result token budget. ``mode`` keeps the default response
    bounded; opt-in ``mode="full"`` returns the original CLI envelope.

    - ``mode="snippet"`` (default): each match's ``text`` is capped at
      ``_SNIPPET_BYTES_CAP`` bytes; ``text_truncated`` and
      ``text_full_bytes`` are added so the agent knows there is more.
    - ``mode="summary"``: each match's ``text`` is dropped entirely;
      citation metadata (``git_sha``, ``github_url``, ``repo_path``,
      ``line_start`` / ``line_end``, ``content_type``, ``score``) is
      preserved so the agent can still point the user at the source.
    - ``mode="full"``: pass-through; no trimming.

    The default ``limit`` is also lowered from 5 to 3 because a single
    snippet-mode match is ~2 KB and three matches comfortably fit in
    any realistic budget.
