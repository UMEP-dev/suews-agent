"""``suews://docs/{slug}`` resource — exposes curated SUEWS doc fragments.

Slugs are **slash-free** (hyphenated) so the ``suews://docs/{slug}`` URI
template routes cleanly — an earlier ``configuration/yaml`` slug was
unreachable because the embedded slash split the URI path. Each slug
maps to one or more real documentation or registry-projection files;
the catalogue is the curated answer to "which docs does a SUEWS user
actually need", aligned with the canonical question set (gh#1384).

Tutorial slugs point at the sphinx-gallery **source** files
(``docs/source/tutorials/tutorial_*.py``) rather than the generated
``auto_examples/*.rst`` output, because the latter only exists after a
docs build and is absent in a plain checkout. The ``.py`` sources carry
the same prose (reStructuredText in the gallery comment blocks) and
resolve in any source tree.

Note: docs are not yet bundled into the wheel, so a non-editable
``pip install`` resolves an empty repo root and the fragments report as
missing. That packaging gap is tracked separately; in an editable /
source checkout (and in the demo) the fragments resolve. Set
``SUEWS_REPO_ROOT`` to point at a checkout explicitly.
