"""Subprocess wrapper around the unified ``suews`` CLI.

Every MCP tool that needs to invoke a SUEWS subcommand goes through
``run_suews_cli`` here. The wrapper enforces four things:

1. The subcommand must be in ``ALLOWED_SUBCOMMANDS``. No arbitrary shell.
2. The subprocess is bounded by a timeout (env-configurable).
3. ``stdout`` is parsed as the standard SUEWS JSON envelope; both success
   and error envelopes are returned to the caller.
4. The child cannot read the MCP server's JSON-RPC stdin transport.

    MCP plugin hosts (Claude Code, Codex, Claude Desktop, Cursor) launch
    MCP servers as subprocesses **without** sourcing a venv. The host's
    PATH is the user's login PATH, which usually does not include the
    venv's ``bin/`` directory. The result: every CLI-backed MCP tool
    fails with "Executable 'suews' not found on PATH" even though
    ``suews`` is installed in the same venv as ``suews-mcp``.

    The MCP server's own Python interpreter (``sys.executable``) is the
    right anchor: ``pip install`` placed ``suews`` as a sibling console
    script in the same directory. We resolve in this order:

    1. ``shutil.which(name, path=Path(sys.executable).parent)`` — looks
       for a sibling console script. ``shutil.which`` honours
       ``PATHEXT`` on Windows so ``suews.exe`` is found correctly.
    2. ``shutil.which(name)`` — falls back to the user's PATH for
       system-wide installs (e.g. ``pipx``).
    3. Return ``name`` unchanged so ``subprocess.run`` still raises a
       useful ``FileNotFoundError`` when nothing is reachable.

    Parameters
    ----------
    subcmd
        Subcommand name. Must be in :data:`ALLOWED_SUBCOMMANDS`.
    args
        Command-line arguments forwarded to the subprocess. ``--format json``
        is appended automatically when not already present.
    project_root
        Working directory for the subprocess. ``None`` keeps the inherited cwd.
    timeout
        Subprocess timeout in seconds.
    suews_executable
        Override the executable path (used for testing). When ``None``
        (the default), :func:`_resolve_suews_executable` anchors lookup
        to ``sys.executable`` so MCP plugin hosts that launch the server
        without sourcing a venv still reach the sibling ``suews`` script
        (gh#1400).

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        The parsed JSON envelope ``{status, data, errors, warnings, meta}``.
        Both success and error envelopes are returned without raising; only
